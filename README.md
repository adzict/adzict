# Hi there, I'm Tanja
## Data Scientist | Data Analyst

## A little about me

I am a novice Data Scientist, with a documented experience in different projects. My Data Science journey started 2.5 years ago, and reached a point where I feel competent enough to tackle real-life data and business challenges. I enjoy working with data, providing relevant insights, as well as upgrading my knowledge on a regular basis (unlike my libraries!). Currently I am working on various projects, finishing my portfolio, and perfecting my data science skills. Also studying for technical interviews.

I post articles on various Data Science topics, usually regarding a project I am currently working on, or regarding a solution to a problem from a particular project.

## My completed projects

- [Box Office Success Determinants](https://github.com/adzict/box_office_determinants)
- [Yelp Reviews Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/adzict/yelp_sentiment_analysis)

## Projects I am currently working on
