# Hi there, I'm Tanja

## About me

Passionate about harnessing the power of data to drive insights and innovation, I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a relentless curiosity for unraveling complex patterns and extracting actionable intelligence. Through professional development and hands-on projects, I have cultivated a robust skillset encompassing data transformation, wrangling, visualization, and analysis. Leveraging Python, SQL, and a suite of data science libraries, I have successfully tackled projects ranging from sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews to in-depth business case analysis on box office success. Guided by seasoned mentors, I have also deployed streamlit apps and unsupervised models, delivering compelling insights and driving data-driven decision-making.

With a strong drive for professional growth, I am highly motivated to collaborate with industry experts, learn from their expertise, and contribute to the success of a dynamic organization. Equipped with a strong educational foundation and practical experience, I am eager to leverage my skills to solve complex business challenges and drive data-led strategies.

Let's connect to explore how my passion for data and commitment to professional development can add value to your business.
